J Interpreter in JavaScript
===========================

This is a start at an interpreter for the J programming language
written in JavaScript. For more information on J, see:

  http://jsoftware.com/

I wrote it to learn more about the J evaluation model. I followed
the outline of the algorithm from the J Dictionary, Section E:

  http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dicte.htm

Very few primitives are currently implemented.

I've made it available on github in case anyone wants to hack on it
and improve it.

Simple examples that work are things like:

  1 2 + 3 4
  (+/%#) 1 2 3 
  ! 0 1 2 3 4
